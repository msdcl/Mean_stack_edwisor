Solution for problem 2 of assignmentt 2


First we have to add an extension to allow access to no 'access-control-allow-origin'header request. Otherwise there will ne an error  
: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.


After this we can get json data.
1. Enter 1 if you want to get episode detail using episode number and season number.
2. Enter 2 if you want to get episode detail using episode id. There can be multiple ids but you have to provide input in comma 
   separated format.
3. Enter 3 if you want to search an episode using name
